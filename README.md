# Crystal Server
This is a personal test project I created on a lab day.

This project is currently not in a working state as the dynamic parts of the router don't work yet as they should.

I tried to recreate some core elements like a router which
dynamically cally controller methods based on the URI's path, pretty much like Rails does.
